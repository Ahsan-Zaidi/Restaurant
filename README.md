## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I have created a landing page as a blueprint for any restaurant looking to improve their website UI. The purpose of this app is to improve my frontend design skills.
